We have two functions: main and encrypt :

main Function:

The main function appears to load a constant tuple containing the string 'FLAG'. It imports the FLAG attribute from a module named secret and stores it in a local variable FLAG.
Then, it copies the value of FLAG to another local variable flag. It assigns the string 'ZHEkjgfhdiIR' to a local variable named key.
Next, it opens a file named 'flag.enc' in write-binary mode. It then calls the encrypt function passing the flag and key as arguments and writes the result to the opened file.

encrypt Function:
The encrypt function initializes an empty bytes object res.
It iterates over the indices of a byte string a.
At each iteration, it performs a byte-wise XOR operation between the byte from a at index i and a byte from string b.
It builds a new byte string from the result and appends it to res.
Once all iterations are complete, it returns the result.
